=====================

Back-end for websites (with a little of front-end in Mason). Managing creating account, login, logout, editing profile, displaying profile, changing password... I hope it could be useful for new website projects in Dancer. I am not the best programmer so if you see a mistake (or better way how to do it) please let me know.
